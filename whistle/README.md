A 128 bit AES key is encrypted with RSA 2048 bit. The RSA uses PKCS 1.5 padding type 1 which is only secure for signatures. The key can be recovered using coppersmiths attack.

Our university has a new on campus whistle blowing system. I want to get the latest campus leakz first hand, so I sniffed the network traffic of the latest submission. Unfortunately the system uses 31337 crypto. Can you still recover the message?
