PW API Part 1
=============

## Description
The correct BLOB in DB dump has to be found and recovered.

## CTF Description

Prof. Hackevoll always forgets his passwords. Thats why he wrote himself a password storage API...

He also used a self developed ticketing system. It got so spammed that he doesn't use it anymore. Maybe you can still find something useful in the database dump I found.
