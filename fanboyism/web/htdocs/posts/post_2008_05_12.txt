Hey folks,

I am writing this post because I think a lot of people out there have never
heard of my perfectly secure key storing system.

You see, most people use a lot of different keys for different services...
Why would you use different keys for HTTPS, GPG, SSH etc? It is difficult to
manage all of these!

My System works as follows:

- Create an RSA key on a trustworthy computer (should be Debian)
- Save the private and public key in all available formats
- Copy the public key to the appropriate locations
- Store the private key securely on an external flash drive in a safe

Complexity is the enemy of security, that's why I think my system is
bullet proof. More people should do it as I do.
